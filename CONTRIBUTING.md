# Contributing
> I welcome feature requests and bug reports. Please read these guidelines before submitting one.

Words that begin with the at sign (@) must be wrapped in backticks! . As a courtesy to avoid sending notifications to any user that might have the @username being referenced, please remember that GitHub usernames also start with the at sign. 
If you don't wrap them in backticks, users will get unintended notifications from you.

GitHub has other great markdown features as well, go [here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) to learn more about them.

# Reporting Issues

It can happen again and again that mistakes have crept in and the code does not work smoothly. That's why you can open a ticket here and get help. However, it should be checked beforehand if someone already had this error and he was already helped. 
You should also have Google search included.
